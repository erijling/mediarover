After being asked by several users if there was a way in which they could donate money to the project, I decided to set one up.  There is now a PayPal donate link at the bottom of the navigation menu on "{{site.url}}":{{site.url}} and there will soon be one on the main GitHub project page.

Thanks for all your support!
