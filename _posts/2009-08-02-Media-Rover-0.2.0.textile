Announcing Media Rover 0.2.0!  This release is primarily a maintenance release.  It contains several fixes for bugs identified by various users since the 0.1.0 release

*Release Details:*

* added new sorting shell scripts (Windows, Linux/OSX)
* updated code to generate filesystem paths following OS conventions
* introduced versioned config files
* documented the use of uppercase template variables
* fixed several bugs with nzb backupdir check
* fixed broken series skip filter
* fixed broken default config path in Windows

*Upgrading:*
This release contains updates that will require all users that are upgrading from a previous version to regenerate their configuration file.

To regenerate your config files, run the following from a terminal:

<pre><code>> python mediarover.py --write-configs</code></pre>

Or, it you'd like the configs written to a specific directory:

<pre><code>> python mediarover.py --write-configs -c /path/to/config/dir</code></pre>

*NOTE:* the default config path under Windows Vista/7 for all previous versions of Media Rover does not follow Microsoft convention.  Media Rover 0.2.0 has been updated to follow established conventions.

Going forward, Windows users (dependent on version) may notice a change in the location of the config files generated by Media Rover.

For Windows XP users:
<pre><code>C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\Mediarover</code></pre>

For Windows Vista/7 users:
<pre><code>C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Mediarover</code></pre>
