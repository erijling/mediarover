mediarover TODO
===============
- update/rewrite all unittests to reflect recent changes
   - write test for mediarover.util.filesystem to verify that it is correctly
	caching episodes when they are retrieved
- add filtering ability, ie. don't want to download nzb's that are labelled
as password protected => "Lost (2004) - 5x05 - blah (password protected)"
- handle tv directory with no season folders, ie all episodes are in one 
folder.
- allow user to specify whether or not they want pre-season recap episodes 
(ie. 3x00)
- look at handling mini or fractional episodes 
(ie. Big Brother (IT) - 9x45a - Daily Show).
	- update regex to look for optional letter following episode number
	- store it in episode object and spit it out whenever converting episode
	to string
- update custom errors to allow setting an error number.  That way I can 
handle different numbered error specifically
	- update util.filesystem to number different errors
- convert all paths to be platform independent, ie. use os.path.join and
os.sep or os.path.normcase
- when looking for download file in sab episode sort script, use os.walk 
instead of os.listdir
- look at moving daily flag to series object as it is a property of the show
- standardize category types that are supported by application
	- each source should return one of supported categories when queried
- when looking for episode on disk, search all subdirectories for possible 
files
- update config write process to merge existing configs with template values
- update SABnzbd plugin to support new session key
- make sure logging_dir config value is an absolute directory
